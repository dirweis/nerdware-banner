# nerdware-banner

Welcome to the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io) project for the nerdware ASCII banner 
challenge!

This tiny Spring Boot application does nothing but printing the nerdware banner during the 
start-up on `System.out`:
                        _                        
                       | |                       
     _ __   ___ _ __ __| |_      ____ _ _ __ ___ 
    | '_ \ / _ \ '__/ _` \ \ /\ / / _` | '__/ _ \
    | | | |  __/ | | (_| |\ V  V / (_| | | |  __/
    |_| |_|\___|_|  \__,_| \_/\_/ \__,_|_|  \___|
    < ===================== Since 2022 ======== >

As one can see, this output contains an error (since the company was not founded in 2022).

The challenge is to correct this wrong output. The code is to be found in `BannerBean.java`.

Have a lot of fun!
